# Crypt Raider

Crypt Raider is a third-person Unreal Engine 5 project I made to practice gameplay programming in C++. It focuses on building clean, modular components, such as pickups, triggers, and basic interaction systems, all without relying heavily on Blueprints.

This version includes just the core `.cpp` and `.h` files inside `Source/CryptRaider/`. Everything else (assets, engine files, etc.) has been left out to keep the repo focused on code.

### Features

- Third-person character movement
- Grabber and Mover components
- Weapon and Projectile system
- Trigger volumes
- Simple pickup system
